    "This notebook demonstrates a micro-simulation of patients visiting clinical staff. We were motivated to develop this micro-simulation in response to a challenge during privacy and anonymity software course to provide an example of a [Graph][1] that would be expected to occur in the health sciences and be analogous to the Graphs that occur social media. Specifically, we where challenged to provide an example of self-referential or recursive, dataset of relationships between pairs of people. To this end, when clinical staff are allowed to be patients as well, and patients are allowed to have multiple visits over a time span, the record of patient visits with clinical staff is a self-referential data set. This dataset turns out to be a [Multi-Graph][2] with the [Edge][3] sets parameterized by time, under the constraint that at any moment in time a patient vertex is unique in the set of all edges that exist at that moment. This constraint amounts to requiring that every patient is involved in only one visit at a time.\n",

    "In developing the micro-simulation we also fortuitously generated a dataset that is at higher risk of re-identification then would be naively calculated based solely on the uniform probability assumptions used in the standard risk calculations. This arose from an effort to make the micro-simulation more realistic by organizing patients and clinical staff into clinics, representing the exclusive employment of the clinical staff at the clinic and the exclusive registration of the patient at the clinic. We further stipulated that patients can only visit the clinical staff of the clinic to which the patient is registered, and that every clinical staff must be registered as a patient at a clinic that is different from the one at which they are employed. In effect for risk calculations, this reduces the population size to that of the average size of a single clinic, because each clinic is a distinct and independent population of patients."
