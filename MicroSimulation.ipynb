    "However this construction naively assumes that any patient can visit any clinician on any given day. This assumption is flawed, and leads overestimating the anonymity of the data. In the most rudimentary form, patients and clinicians are subdivided into clinics. Each clinic is effectively a smaller subpopulation, constraining the clinicians a patient can see, and the patients a clinician can see. Furthermore, the clinicians work according to a shift schedule, so that the clinicians that can be seen on any given day is constrained to a smaller subset. Finally clinicians generally do not treat themselves. In the context of this simulation we accomplish this by ensuring no clinician is a patient at the clinic in which they are employed.\n",

    "The implication for anonymity is that the effective probability of one person is scaled down by the clinic size. For example in a population of $1000000$ people with $1000$ clinics, the events of a single person is effectively a sample from $1$ in $1000$, not $1$ in $1000000$, because there are only $1000$ patients per clinic on average."
